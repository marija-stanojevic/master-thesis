<h3>Determination of the similarity between the scientific papers using machine learning methods</h3>

Topic of my master thesis was determination of similarity between the scientific papers using machine learning methods. Corpus is downloaded from arxiv.org and includes all abstracts uploaded from 2009 year together with labels, ie. categories and subcategories of the abstract. Abstract can have multiple categories and subcategories, but for evaluation, only first category/subcategory is used.

Full description of work, results as well as overview of natural language processing (NLP) methods is given in thesis (in Serbian): https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwOaPYkiPMKIWVRxcDJCTGNjNDQ/view?usp=sharing.
